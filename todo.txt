OUTSTANDING

Fix relative position for selection helper
Simplify creation of planes?

menu/button control selection type (whole object, partial object)

drag select all items inside selection
drag select all items intersecting selection

group selected into base and move, rotate, scale

select object, face, edge, vertex
undo/redo
three.js helpers

add to selection
remove from selection


find all object3Ds that are wholly inside the selection volume
find all object3Ds that are partially or wholly inside the selection volume - watch out for intersections

	* INTERSECTIONS
	* ENCLOSED

	find candidates further checks
	quick test - is centroid inside - then intersection selected
	does bounding box intersect
	-- if only one vertex is inside then must be an intersection (which is quicker, point inside or face intersects?)



Is position a valid centre for all objects?
instanced geometry, model, bounding box, bounding sphere

optimise by merging vertices

	helpers don't work when in arrays (is it helpers or planes?)
	planes block raycaster pick
	bounding boxes are static

DONE
click select
Use "backdrop" to build plane for selection area -> volume
use selection box helper
move/rotate camera
start selection on mouse down, finish on mouse up
show planes
show selction area
	const helper = new SelectionHelper( selectionBox, renderer, 'selectBox' );
clear any previous selection when starting

backdrop -> invisible, billboard, child of camera
	if child of camera won't need billboad
	layer?
	intersect with invisible?
	draw selection area
